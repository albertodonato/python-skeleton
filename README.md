# Skeleton tree for python projects

This is a helper script to setup a typical python project.

It takes a few config options and generates a tree with template/boilerplate
files for further customization.


Usage
-----

- copy the `project-template.yaml` to `project.yaml` and edit it with personal
  and project details.

- run `./python-skeleton -C project.yaml <destdir>`

- go into `<destdir>`, edit generated files as needed and add actual project
  files.
