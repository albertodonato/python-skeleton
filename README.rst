python-skeleton
================

Helper script to setup a typical python project.

It takes a few config options and generates a tree with template/boilerplate
files for further customization.


Usage
-----

- edit the ``project.yaml`` with personal and project details
- run

  $$ python-skeleton/project -C project.yaml <destdir>

edit generated files there and add code.


You can edit ``project.list`` to change which files are included in the
generation.
